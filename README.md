Website for Wheaton College, MA alumnus to connect

* Show off Alumns

    - What they're doing
         * Timeline on detail view (not priority)
         * How often they moved from company to company
* Give them way to communicate -> NO FORUM (Use Facebook and LinkedIn API to list profiles)
	- Place for them to all connect with each other (**use Facebook**)

* Map of where they are
